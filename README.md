# triangle

Just an experiment I did to learn Haskell. It's the first (and at this writing, only)
largish Haskell program I ever wrote; and consequently it is very far from a model
of style, I would suppose. I had the idea to functionally generate a video; it came
out OK. There's lots I would change, much I would reconsider about the implementation,
etc., but the output is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rephxifBVNs), if you're
curious!
